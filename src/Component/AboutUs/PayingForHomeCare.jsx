            When you or someone you care about decides that they need care at home, we understand that having to think about paying for care can be a difficult decision.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Depending on your personal circumstances, the local authority (Wirral Borough Council or Flintshire County Council) may be able to meet some or all of your costs for home care.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            It may be that the local authority will agree to pay for some aspects of your care but not agree to pay for others. This is very common and we usually have separate arrangements in place to cover this shortfall directly with the service user and/or their families.
